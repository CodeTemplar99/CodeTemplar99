# Howdy,  I'm Mitchell 👋
known online as CodeTemplar or CodeTemplar99 ***(pronunced code templar nine-nine)***, I'm an experienced software developer and a fullstack web developer who constantly seeks out innovative solutions to everyday problems. In my 3 years in this industry, I've honed my analytical thinking and collaboration skills, and I enjoy working with a team. My Web stack is: a truckload of Django and Vue, and react, and a handful of php. And I've had a thrilling opportunity to work on a few projects with these technologies.

Before my current position, I was a junior frontend intern with Codekago interactive. While working there, I committed to frontend development, which has been my specialty for a about 2 years. I understand that a major part of your straying into this area (my bio ofcourse :smile: ) focuses on some of these I've mentioned, which my previous experience has certainly prepared me for.

Here are a few takeaways from me 📣

  * 🚧  Bookings: I'm currently learning and I am trying to raise my bar in Node.js, I'm also interested in game development and AR/VR so most times I could be caught working on a hobbyist project in this area, I believe the possiblities with this technologies can only be limited of he who yields the imagination. I'm also working on an online crypto exchange platform (name to be written here soon :wink:) to help Nigerians buy and sell crypto at this time that the government has decided to ban banks from processing crypto-related transactions.

* 🔌  Availablity: I'm open to software roles/collaboration on Django, Vue, React and general fullstack development.
* ❗  I'm spontenous and passion-driven
* ⚠️  There's no guarantee that I'll be writing these same stack in the next few months 

* Whether it's a new project, a job role or why your stack is better than mine (but know you won't win, after all what are talks for? 😄), I'm reachable and welcome to nice talks. try one of these channels
